# AmanahBlock - Blockchain-Based Charitable Donation Platform

## Project Overview

AmanahBlock is a decentralized, blockchain-powered system designed to revolutionize charitable giving. It integrates smart contracts, Shariah-compliant financial practices, AI-driven insights, and user-friendly interfaces to address key challenges in the charitable sector.

## System Architecture

The platform is organized into six interconnected layers:

1. **Donation Layer**: Collects and routes donations based on donor preferences
2. **Fund Management Layer**: Manages centralized and specific pools for targeted causes
3. **Investment Layer**: Facilitates Shariah-compliant investments to grow untagged funds
4. **Project Layer**: Allocates funds to milestone-based projects
5. **Governance Layer**: Ensures Shariah compliance and regulatory adherence
6. **Transparency Layer**: Tracks transactions and prioritizes fund allocation using AI and donor feedback

## Key Features

- **Multiple Donation Types**: Support for cash, waqf assets, and NFT-based food donations
- **Shariah-Compliant Investments**: Growth of funds through musharakah and mudarabah structures
- **Milestone-Based Project Funding**: Ensures accountability and verifiable impact
- **Real-Time Transparency**: Blockchain-based audit trails and interactive dashboards
- **AI-Driven Insights**: Recommends high-impact projects and optimal fund allocation
- **Decentralized Governance**: DAO voting system for funding decisions
- **P2P Currency Exchange**: Converts MYR to USDT without interest (Riba)

## Addressing Core Challenges

- **Lack of Transparency**: Tamper-proof ledger and real-time dashboards
- **Inefficiencies and High Costs**: Automated processes and reduced intermediaries
- **Fraud and Mismanagement**: Compliance monitoring and milestone-based disbursements
- **Donor Disengagement**: Personalized impact reports and feedback mechanisms
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in governance and Shariah compliance

## Technical Implementation

- Built on scalable blockchain infrastructure (Ethereum/Binance Smart Chain)
- Smart contracts developed in Solidity
- Integration with P2P exchange platforms
- Machine learning models for data analysis
- Web dashboards for user interaction
- Robust security measures including cryptographic encryption

## Expected Outcomes

- Enhanced trust through transparent operations
- Improved efficiency with automated processes
- Increased impact via strategic fund allocation
- Stronger donor engagement through personalization
- Global scalability across diverse regions
- Full regulatory and Shariah compliance

## Getting Started with Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
