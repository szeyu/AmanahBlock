| **Investment Layer** | Grows unallocated funds through Shariah-compliant investments |
| **Project Layer** | Disburses funds to milestone-verified projects |
| **Governance Layer** | Maintains compliance and enforces platform rules |
| **Transparency Layer** | Tracks donations via blockchain and AI-driven feedback |

## 🛠️ Admin Dashboard - AI Proposal Review
**Problem**: Manual review of proposals is slow and prone to Shariah non-compliance.  
**Solution**: AI scans proposals for compliance and enables chat-based review for accuracy and speed.

---

## 💸 Donation Journey - More Payment Options
**Problem**: Traditional platforms lack inclusive payment options.  
**Solution**: Accepts crypto, FPX, TnG, and physical goods. Includes map for drop-offs and delivery integration via Lalamove.

---

## 🔗 Transparency - Real-Time Donation Flow
**Problem**: Donors can't trace where funds go.  
**Solution**: Blockchain-backed transaction history, live status blocks, NFTs, QR-coded receipts for traceability.

---

## 🏗️ Project Tracking & Partnerships
**Problem**: Vague project updates reduce trust.  
**Solution**: Milestone-verified funding, blockchain records, and corporate CSR integration for sustainable support.

---

## 🗳️ DAO Voting - Public Emergency Fund Decisions
**Problem**: Emergency fund distribution lacks community input.  
**Solution**: On-chain voting empowers donors and scholars to decide funding priorities.

---

## 📋 Smart Zakat Calculator
**Problem**: Manual Zakat calculations are slow and error-prone.  
**Solution**: OCR scanning autofills fields for fast, accurate Zakat fulfillment.

## 🧭 Zakat Pool System & Malaysia Impact Map
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Zakat Pool** | Auto-distributes to 8 asnaf categories with donor tracking |
| **Impact Map** | Tap location to view nearby verified projects and donate instantly |
